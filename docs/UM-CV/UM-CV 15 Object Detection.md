## Intro

### Task Definition

Input: Single RGB image
Outputï¼š A set of detected objects; for each object predict:

Computer Vision Tasks:Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation


1. Category label (from fixed, known set of categories)
2. Bounding box (four numbers, x, y, width, height)

### Challenges

- Multiple outputs: Need to output variable numbers of objects per image
- Multiple types of output" Need to predict "what" (category label) as well as
  "where" (bounding box)
- Large images: Classification works at 224 x 224; need higher resolution for
  detection, often 800 x 800 or more
- Detecting Multiple Objects: Need different numbers of outputs per image


## Region-based CNN (R-CNN)

CVPR 2014

### Window Detection

#### Sliding Window?

- Apply a cnn to many different crops of the image, CNN classifies each crop as
  object or background.  And enumerate all possible crops -> too slow.
- Region Proposals: Find a small set of boxes that are likely to cover all
  objects. Often based on heuristics: e.g. look for "blob-like" image regions.
  This is relatively fast to run; e.g. Selective Search gives 2000 region
  proposals in a few seconds on CPU


- Regions of interest (RoI) from a proposal methods.  For each RoI, apply a CNN
  to predict the class of the object in the RoI and refine the bounding box.
- Bounding box regression: predict "transform" to correct the RoI: x, y, w, h

Fig: R-CNN</div>

During training, backpropagate on all the regions of interest (RoIs).

### Comparing Boxes: Intersection over Union (IoU)

- IoU = Area of overlap / Area of union. Also called "Jaccard similarity" or "Jaccard index".
- IoU > 0.5 is "decent". IoU > 0.7 is "good". IoU > 0.9 is "almost perfect".

#### Overlapping Boxes

Object detectors often output many overlapping detections. Solution: Post-process raw detections using Non-Max Suppression (NMS).

1. Select next highest-scoring box
2. Eliminate lower-scoring boxes with IoU > threshold

<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;">
  <img src="/images/um-cv-2/15-3.png" width="70%" alt="Non-Max Suppression"  /><br>
Fig: Non-Max Suppression</div>

Problem: NMS may eliminate "good" boxes when objects are highly overlapping... 

### Evaluating Object Detectors: Mean Average Precision (mAP)

1. Run object detector on all test images (with NMS)
2. For each category, compute average precision (AP) = area under precision vs recall curve

<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;">
  <img src="/images/um-cv-2/15-4.png" width="70%" alt="Mean Average Precision"  /><br>
Fig: Mean Average Precision</div>

3. mean Average Precision (mAP) = mean of AP over all categories
4. for "COCO mAP", average over 10 IoU thresholds (0.5 to 0.95) and take average

## Fast-RCNN

ICCV 2015

<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;">
  <img src="/images/um-cv-2/15-6.png" width="70%" alt="Fast-RCNN"  /><br>
Fig: Fast-RCNN</div>

### Crop Features: RoI Pool

Input Image: e.g. 3 x 640 x 480 -> CNN (e.g. 512 x 20 x15)

Project and snap RoI to CNN feature map - > Divide into 2x2 grid of (roughly) equal subregions -> Max pool within each subregion (e.g. 512 x 7 x 7)

Region features always the same size even if input regions have different sizes!

<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;">
  <img src="/images/um-cv-2/15-7.png" width="70%" alt="RoI Pool"  /><br>
Fig: RoI Pool</div>

Problem: Slight misalignment between RoI and CNN grid can cause misalignment in RoI Pooling. Solution: RoI Align

### RoI Align

- Instead of snapping RoI to CNN grid, interpolate between grid points
- More accurate, but more expensive

<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;">
  <img src="/images/um-cv-2/15-8.png" width="70%" alt="RoI Align"  /><br>
Fig: RoI Align</div>

The cropping may not perfectly match the original object grid. RoI Align
implements a bilinear near-neighbor interpolation to get more accurate cropping.
We can consider the image as a real-valued tensor and backpropagate to any
points in the image.

## Faster R-CNN: Learnable Region Proposals

**Region Proposal Network (RPN):**

Fig: Region Proposal Network</div>

- Anchor box of fixed size at each point in the feature map.
- At each point, predict whether the corresponding anchor contains an object or
  not (per-cell logistic regression, predict scores with conv layer.)
- For positive boxes, also predict a box transform to regress from anchor to
  object box. 

- Problem: Anchor box may be too small or too large for the object. Solution:
  K Multi-scale anchors for each point.

<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;">
  <img src="/images/um-cv-2/15-12.png" width="70%" alt="Multi-scale anchors"  /><br>
Fig: Multi-scale anchors</div>

Jointly with 4 losses:

1. RPN classification loss: anchor box is object or not
2. RPN regression loss: predict transform from anchor box to proposal box
3. Object classification: classify proposals as background or object class
4. Object regression: predict transform from a proposal box to object box

Two stages:

First stage: Run once per image
- Backbone Network
- Region proposal network

Second stage: Run once per region
- Crop features: RoI pool/align
- Predict object class
- Prediction bbox offset

## Single-Stage Object Detection

- YOLO: You Only Look Once. ECCV 2016
- Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection. ICCV 2017

## Detection without Anchors: CornerNet (ECCV 2018)

Use a backbone CNN to predict the heatmap of object upper-left corners and
lower-right corners.

To match the upper-left and lower-right corners, use a "associative embedding"
to predict the offset between the two corners.

## Comparison

[Speed/accuracy trade-offs for modern convolutional object detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10012) CVPR 2017

Takeaways:
- Two stage method (e.g. Faster R-CNN) is more accurate but slower
- Single stage methods (e.g. YOLO, SSD) are faster but less accurate
- Bigger backbones improve performance, but are slower
- Nowadays, single stage methods are as good as two-stage methods
- Very big models work better
- Test-time augmentation pushes numbers up
- Big ensembles, more data, etc
