<h2 style="margin-top:0;"> About </h2>

Hi there! I’m Yiming Chen, currently pursuing a dual degree at École Polytechnique, specializing in statistics and random phenomena modeling. My research focuses on computer vision and Diffusion Models with Point Control.

I’m also involved in studying the consistency of video diffusion models at [SJTU-Mediabrain](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/). If you're passionate about computer vision, Diffusion Models, or the future of AI, I’d love to connect and exchange ideas.
