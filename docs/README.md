<h2> About </h2>

Hi there! I’m Yiming Chen, currently pursuing a dual degree at École
Polytechnique, specializing in statistics and random phenomena modeling. I am
also a MSc in information enginnering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My
research focuses on computer vision and 3D scene understanding.

I’m currently involved in studying 3D scene generation and 3D panoptic
segmentation at [Mediabrain](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/) Laboratory
affiliated with [Cooperative Media Innovation Center, SJTU](https://cmic.sjtu.edu.cn/CN/Default.aspx).
If you're passionate about
computer vision, GenAI, or statistics, I’d love to connect and exchange ideas.
