<h2 style="margin-top:0; border-top: 1px solid var(--vp-c-border);"> About </h2>

Hi there! I’m Yiming Chen, a dual-degree student at École Polytechnique and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, specializing in statistics and random phenomena modeling. My research focuses on computer vision and 3D reconstruction.

Currently, I am working on Physics-based 3D Asset Generation for Embodied AI Training, under the supervision of [Professor Weidi Xie](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Vtrqj4gAAAAJ&hl=en), at Mediabrain Laboratory affiliated with [Shanghai Jiao Tong University Cooperative Media Innovation Center](https://cmic.sjtu.edu.cn/CN/Default.aspx). 

If you share a passion for computer vision, generative models, the future of AI, or if we share the same interests, feel free to reach out—I’d be happy to connect and share ideas!
