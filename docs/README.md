<h2 style="margin-top:0; border-top: 1px solid var(--vp-c-border);"> About </h2>

Hi there! I’m Yiming Chen, currently pursuing a dual degree at École Polytechnique, specializing in statistics and random phenomena modeling. My research focuses on computer vision and Diffusion Models with Point Control.

I’m currently involved in studying the consistency of video diffusion models at Mediabrain Laboratory affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University Cooperative Media Innovation Center (https://cmic.sjtu.edu.cn/CN/Default.aspx). If you're passionate about computer vision, Diffusion Models, or the future of AI, I’d love to connect and exchange ideas.
