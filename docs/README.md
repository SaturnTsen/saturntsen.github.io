## About

Hello there! I'm Yiming CHEN, currently pursuing a dual degree at École Polytechnique, with a focus on Statistics and Random Phenomena Modeling. My current research revolves around computer vision and Diffusion Models with Point Control. 

Beyond research, I’m drawn to activities that connect me with both creativity and nature, such as horseback riding, gardening, and music. To me, life is a delicate interplay between the logical precision of science and the intuitive beauty of art.

Right now, I’m fully immersed in my project in [SJTU-Mediabrain](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/), aiming to contribute a small but meaningful piece to the broader academic puzzle. At the same time, I’m actively looking for summer internship opportunities to bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

If you’re passionate about computer vision, Diffusion Models, or the future of AI, I’d love to connect and exchange ideas. Let’s explore the endless possibilities this field has to offer!
